            <p><i>Open on a closed exterior door. <span class="character black">LANDLORD</span> is unlocking the door, while <span class="character red">ROOMMATE 1</span> and <span class="character blue" >ROOMMATE 2</span> are standing behind the camera.</i></p>
            <p><i><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span> fiddles with the door for a second before opening it, as the door open, the camera moves to inside the hallway, facing the group. We do not see the rest of the hallway/.</i>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - And this is the place.</p>
            <p><b><span class="character red">ROOMMATE 1</span></b> - Oh wow, look at that nice shade of Mustard Yellow (<i>Or similarly off colour, could be the actual colour of the walls, or the complete opposite.</i>)... wait,. what's that?</p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - Oh that? It's the complimentary black mold. It comes with all houses nowadays.</p>
            <p><b><span class="character blue">ROOMMATE 2</span></b> - I don't think thats... (<i>Gets cut off</i>)</p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - And if you follow me down the hallway, you'll see the first bedroom.</p>
            <p><i>Camera moves down the hall as the trio goes further into the apartment, keeping the 3 in shot while hiding anything else.</i></p>
            <p><b><span class="character red">ROOMMATE 1</span></b> - So... spacious.</p>
            <p><i>Camera rotates to show what is essentially a closet. Ideally, this is an actual closet, and is either completely empty, or stuffed to the brim.</i></p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - Yup, it even has a window! A rare find around here.</p>
            <p><b><span class="character red">ROOMMATE 1</span></b> - Does it come with the carpet?</p>
            <p><i>The closet should not have a carpet.</i></p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - Nope. (<i>Pause</i>) Well, now if you look across the hallway, there's the kitchen. Recently remodeled.</i></p>
            <p><i>Camera turns around, avoiding showing the remainder of the hallway, and turns to a kitchen. There should be a hole at about eye level w/ the camera. Can either be an actual hole, or a black circle taped onto the wall.</i></p>
            <p><b><span class="character blue">ROOMMATE 2</span></b> - Hmm... I'm pretty sure I just saw... (<i>Gets cut off, again</i>)</p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - And that would be your complimentary pet. Keep in mind that this is the only pet allowed on the lease.</p>
            <p><b><span class="character red">ROOMMATE 1</span></b> - Is it friendly?</p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - Only if you feed it cheese.</p>
            <p><i>During that interaction, we see a "pet" go through the hole. This should be something akin to a mouse or rat. Can either be a clearly edited in render, or something on a string. PLEASE DO NOT USE A REAL RODENT.</i></p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - And there's the other bedroom, but that's boring. Instead, take a look at the <i>pristine</i> bathroom. (<i>Add extra enthesis on the pristine</i>)</p>
            <p><i>Camera turns back towards the people during this, where we follow them go to another room, where the camera turns around to an empty room with just a single bucket. Ideally, the lights will be off in this room.</i></p>
            <p><b><span class="character red">ROOMMATE 1</span></b> - Awesome!</p>
            <p><b><span class="character blue">ROOMMATE 2</span></b> - Is this even legal?</p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - Of course it is! Unfortunately, the shower is currently being renovated. For now, you will need to go upstairs and ask your neighbors to borrow theirs.</p>
            <p><b><span class="character red">ROOMMATE 1</span></b> - Sounds normal, I had to do that back in (<i>Insert city that isn't Worcester.</i>)</p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</b> - Yup. Any questions?</p>
            <p><b><span class="character blue">ROOMMATE 2</span></b> - Several. First off... (<i>Cut off again</i>)</p>
            <p><b><span class="character red">ROOMMATE 1</span></b> - Nope! When can we sign?</p>
            <p><b><span class="character black">LANDLORD</span></b> - I have the lease right here.</p>
            <p><i>The <span class="character black">LANDLORD</span> hands them a paper, something akin to the Hunter Clickbait warrants, or a poster for this show, or something else. During this, the scene fades to black as the title card "The Landlord Special" shows up, before it also fades away.</i></p>
