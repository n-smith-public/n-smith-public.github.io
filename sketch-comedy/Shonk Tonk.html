                    <p><i>Pretend to pan to The Sharks, except it is just in MS Paint of horribly drawn sharks.<br><br><b style="color:#26d85e">AVERY</b> walks into the Shark Tank, which is just any random conference room on campus. The time is at night. There is a table in the corner with nothing on it.</i></p>
                    <p><b><span style="color:#ff0000">ANNOUNCER</span></b> - And now let’s meet our first investor, Avery/Adam Hawthorne! Born and raised in the picturesque town of Willowbrook, nestled in the heart of New England, they grew up in a modest household with middle-income parents. Avery experienced the essence of the traditional American Dream firsthand. Avery possessed a peculiar talent—they could predict the weather with uncanny accuracy, often leaving friends and family amazed by their forecasts. Despite their seemingly ordinary life, Avery's extraordinary weather predictions became a quirky yet cherished aspect of their personality, earning them the affectionate nickname "The Rainmaker" among the locals in Willowbrook.</p>
                    <p><b><span style="color:#26d85e">AVERY</span></b> - Good morning sharks.</p>
                    <p><b><span style="color:#2679d8">SHARKS</span></b>, <i>off camera. Various responses such as “Hello”, “Hey”, “‘Sup”.</i></p>
                    <p><b><span style="color:#26d85e">AVERY</span></b> - My name is Avery Hawthorne, and I am the CEO of the next biggest company, <i>Toast It!</i> Many years ago, I was living with my sister Zyra Galaxia in a small apartment in Ontario when we came up with a brilliant idea. We like to call it, “The Toaster”. With “The Toaster”, you are able to travel through time!</p>
                    <p><b><span style="color:#26d85e">AVERY</span></b><i> places a microwave, or similar non-toaster item onto the table.</i></p>
                    <p><b><span style="color:#26d85e">AVERY</span></b> <i>(continuing)</i>- With “The Toaster” you are able to dial how far back in time you want to go based on the temperature dial, set how long you want to be there, stick some lovely bread in there and off you go! I am seeking $320,000 for a 12% stake in my company. </p>
                    <p><i>Camera pans to the other side of the room, where the “Sharks are”. Behind the table is a Blahaj, a stock photo of a whale shark, a stock photo of a great white shark, and an actor wearing either a shark outfit, or Aquarium merch.<br><br>Note: This can also use other shark plushies if available, just make sure only one is human.</i></p>
                    <p><b><span style="color:#2679d8">SHARKS</span></b><i>(or, well, the sole human)</i>- Nah.</p>
